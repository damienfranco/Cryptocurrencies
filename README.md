# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The aim of this project is to create a report for a prospective cryptocurrency investment portfolio that may be given to an investment bank. This document will cover the cryptocurrencies available on the market, as well as how they might be grouped together to provide a classification system for this new venture.

## Process

Unsupervised machine learning is being utilized on the data. I chose to use a clustering algorithm to sort the cryptocurrencies.

## Summary

In this study, we organized 532 cryptocurrency offerings based on their similarities in terms of characteristics. The outliers, such as the fact that class 2 has only a few cryptocurrencies, were discovered. The majority of cryptocurrencies are classified as class 0 or 1.

When two cryptocurrency features are plotted against each other, the different categories do not easily separate. The PCA technique is ideal for more accurate visualizations. To identify the effectiveness and potential interest of each group's performance and opportunities for investment bank clients, unique data from all groups must be investigated.
